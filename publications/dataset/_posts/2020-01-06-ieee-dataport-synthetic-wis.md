We provide a dataset with synthetic white images for the Lytro Illum light field camera with precisely known microlens center coordinates.
The dataset consists of white images taken at different zoom settings as well as different microlens array offset and rotation.
The white images have been raytraced using a thin lens-based camera model. The synthesized white images incorporate natural as well as mechanical vignetting effects.
For every microlens, a precise center coordinate is provided from which the orthogonal and perspective projections onto the camera sensor can be calculated.
For details on the camera model as well as usage of the dataset, please consult our main paper as well as the linked source code repositories.

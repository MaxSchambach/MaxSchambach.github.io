We investigate four algorithms for microlens center detection, two of which have not been previously discussed in the literature. Using a physical approach, we create a set of
81 synthetic white images with known microlens center coordinates. Applying the different detection algorithms to the synthetic white images, we are able to quantitatively evaluate their respective performance in terms of accuracy, precision and recall. Overall, the proposed methods outperform the ones that have been previously published.

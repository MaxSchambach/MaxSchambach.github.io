We investigate the classical and quantum Proca field (a massive vector potential) of mass $m > 0$ in arbitrary globally hyperbolic spacetimes and in the presence of external sources. We motivate a notion of continuity in the mass for families of observables {Om}m>0 and we investigate the massless limit $m \to 0$. Our limiting procedure is local and covariant and it does not require a choice of reference state. We find that the limit exists only on a subset of observables, which automatically implements a gauge equivalence on the massless vector potential. For topologically nontrivial spacetimes, one may consider several inequivalent choices of gauge equivalence and our procedure selects the one which is expected from considerations involving the Aharonov–Bohm effect and Gauss' law.

We note that the limiting theory does not automatically reproduce Maxwell's equation, but it can be imposed consistently when the external current is conserved. To recover the correct Maxwell dynamics from the limiting procedure would require an additional control on limits of states. We illustrate this only in the classical case, where the dynamics is recovered when the Lorenz constraint remains well behaved in the limit.

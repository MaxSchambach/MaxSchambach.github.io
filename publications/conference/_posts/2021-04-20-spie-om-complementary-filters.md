We propose a novel multispectral imaging technique employing complementary notch filters instead of bandpass
filters which are conventionally used in filter-based multispectral cameras. Therefore, only little power of the
incoming photon signal is lost and thus the SNR of the multispectral data can be significantly improved. To
validate the proposed approach, simulations of the conventional bandpass filters as well as the complementary notch
filters are presented. To compare the resulting SNRs, the EMVA 1288 standard is adopted in such a way that it
is applicable to notch filter-based multispectral cameras. It is found that the SNR can be significantly improved
by using complementary filters instead of the conventional bandpass filters, especially at high spectral resolution.

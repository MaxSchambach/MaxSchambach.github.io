title: "About Me"
---

I  am a 5th year **PhD student** with [IIIT] at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)] under supervision of [Michael Heizmann].

My research interests lies in machine learning and its applications in **computational imaging**.
I am particularly interested in joint hardware & software optimization to develop novel imaging techniques.


Currently, I am working on reconstruction from spectrally coded light fields where I have obtained experise in image and signal processing, compressed sensing, and computer vision.

I received a **BSc in Physics** from Jena University in 2013 and a **MSc in Physics** from Leipzig University in 2016.
In my Master's thesis I worked on quantum fields in curved spacetimes, investigation the quantization of the Proca field in globally hyperbolic spacetimes and its zero mass limit, under supervision of [Ko Sanders] and [Stefan Hollands].
Despite having swiched my main focus to computer vision, I still enjoy catching up with the latex [physics](https://www.quantamagazine.org/) [news](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/).

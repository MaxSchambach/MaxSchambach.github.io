I  am a 5th year **PhD student** with [IIIT]{:target="_blank"} at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)]{:target="_blank"} under the supervision of [Michael Heizmann]{:target="_blank"}.
I have recently defended my PhD [thesis]{:target="_blank"} discussing the reconstruction from coded light fields.

My research interests lie in machine learning and its applications in **computational imaging**.
I am particularly interested in joint hardware & software optimization to develop novel imaging techniques.
More broadly, I enjoy applied computer vision research, in particular with an industrial focus.

Currently, I am working on the reconstruction from spectrally coded light fields, where I have obtained expertise in image and signal processing, compressed sensing, computer vision, and deep learning.
Moreover, I have hands-on experience with camera hardware, prototyping, calibration, and (real-world and synthetic) dataset creation.

I received a **B.S. in Physics** from Jena University in 2013 and a **M.S. in Physics** from Leipzig University in 2016.
In my Master's thesis I worked on quantum fields in curved spacetimes, investigating the quantization of the Proca field in globally hyperbolic spacetimes and its zero mass limit, under supervision of [Ko Sanders]{:target="_blank"} and [Stefan Hollands]{:target="_blank"}.
Despite having switched my main focus to computer vision, I still enjoy catching up with the latest [physics](https://www.quantamagazine.org/){:target="_blank"} [news](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/){:target="_blank"}.

Microlens arrays (MLAs) have a variety of applications in, e.g., display systems, projection optics, and sensor applications. \
They can be manufactured by various fabrication methods.
Among all, inkjet printing stands out because it offers a simple, fast, and low-cost fabrication route. \
However, extra manufacturing steps such as photolithography were so far involved to pre-structure the substrate in order to improve the uniformity of the printed MLAs and achieve a high fill factor. 
In this study, we report the fabrication of MLAs on unstructured substrates by inkjet printing using an optimized UV-curable ink on top of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). 
The latter allows for tuning the surface free energy and thus the aspect ratio of the microlenses. 
We achieve an unprecedented fill factor of 88%. Digitally controlled large area fabrication is demonstrated, both, on rigid as well as on flexible substrates, opening a pathway for customized microoptics by additive manufacturing.

I am a **Senior AI Scientist** at [SAP](https://www.sap.com){:target="_blank"} working on foundation models for tabular data. My research interests lie in machine learning and its applications in challenging practical scenarios â€“ currently with a focus on tabular representation learning and large tabular models.

Previously, I was a **Research Team Lead** at [Merantix Momentum](https://merantix-momentum.com/){:target="_blank"}, which I joined in early 2022 as a **Senior Machine Learning Researcher**, focussing on ML applications in manufacturing.
Prior, I obtained a **PhD** from [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)]{:target="_blank"} under the supervision of [Michael Heizmann]{:target="_blank"}, where I worked on compressive light field imaging and other 3D and spectral imaging-related problems in Computer Vision. 
Here, I have obtained expertise in image and signal processing, compressed sensing, computer vision, and deep learning. 
Moreover, I have hands-on experience with camera hardware, prototyping, calibration, and real-world and synthetic dataset creation.

I received a **B.S. in Physics** from Jena University in 2013 and a **M.S. in Physics** from Leipzig University in 2016.
In my Master's thesis I worked on quantum fields in curved spacetimes, investigating the quantization of the Proca field in globally hyperbolic spacetimes and its zero mass limit, under supervision of [Ko Sanders]{:target="_blank"} and [Stefan Hollands]{:target="_blank"}.
Despite having switched my main focus to computer vision, I still enjoy catching up with the latest [physics](https://www.quantamagazine.org/){:target="_blank"} [news](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/){:target="_blank"}.

title: "Welcome to my website!"

Moin! I have finally managed to put together a website using GitHub pages and the [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) Jekyll template.

I have fiddled around quite a bit with it to get a custom CV and automated list of publications.
Feel free to fork this from my [GitHub repository].
